Signal Propagation and Logging:

Use a message queue to log received signals.
Implement signal handlers in each process to handle SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, and SIGTERM accordingly.
Process Workflow:

P1 reads input, writes to FIFO.
P2 reads from FIFO, counts characters, writes to shared memory.
P3 reads from shared memory and outputs the result.
Handling Signals:

Implement a mechanism to identify and verify the sender of each signal.
Use a structured approach to notify subsequent processes when a signal is handled.
Clean-Up:

Ensure that all resources (message queues, shared memory, semaphores, FIFOs) are released once all processes have terminated.
Additional Considerations:
File and Input Handling: Choose the input file dynamically to test the systemâ€™s efficiency.
Concurrency and Synchronization: Handle potential race conditions when accessing shared memory with semaphores.
Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test with various inputs and simulate signal sending to ensure robust handling.
